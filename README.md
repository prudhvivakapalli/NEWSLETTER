A minimalistic and elegant daily newsletter subscription page with a dark blurred glass theme. Here's a breakdown of the key features:

1. Dark Background: The page uses a gradient background from dark gray to black, creating a sleek and modern look.
2. Frosted Glass Effect: The main content area has a backdrop blur effect with a slight white overlay, giving it a frosted glass appearance.
3. Minimalistic Typography: The text is kept simple with high contrast against the dark background. The title "Daily Insights" is prominently displayed.
4. Newsletter Subscription Form: A clean and simple form with an email input field and a subscribe button. The email icon adds a nice touch to the input field.
5. Animations: Using Framer Motion, the content fades in and slides up slightly when the page loads, adding a subtle but engaging effect.
6. Responsive Design: The layout is centered and has a maximum width, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
7. Accessibility: The form uses proper labels and ARIA attributes to ensure it's accessible to screen readers.
